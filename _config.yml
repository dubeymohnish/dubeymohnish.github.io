                Hi, my name is Mohnish Dubey, and I am a Senior Researcher at Smart Data Analytics and InfAI. Currently, I am leading the e-VITA project at InfAI, working towards designing knowledege graph based dailogue system to support active and healthy ageing. 

                Previously, I have worked as a Dialogue Engineer at Fraunhofer IAIS for more than three years. In 2021, I compeleted my PhD from University of Bonn, Germany. 
                I have worked in the research area of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs, Dialogue Systems, Entity Linking, Relation Linking, Large Dataset Generation, Answer Representation, and general NLP and KG tasks.

          - Lead to the development of question answering system over DBpedia. 
          - Here Natural language questions are normalized into an intermediary canonical syntactic form and then translated into a SPARQL
          - A rule based system for question answering over DBpedia Knowledge Graph

          - Lead the project with aim to create a Question Answering data set with the pair of Natural Language question to their corresponding SPARQL query. 
          - LC-QuAD 1.0 published a dataset of 5,000 question over DBpedia. 
          - LC-QuAD 2.0 published a dataset of 30,000 question over Wikidata.

          - Developed the component to performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint single task. 
          - First by modeling the problem to Generalised Travelling Salesman Problem. 
          - Second using machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph.

          - In this internal Fraunhofer project we developed a template based question answering system 
          - We targeted ARD Video annotations, and fetch videos based on userâ€™s input in German language.

          - A large scale dataset for answer verbaliser for simple natural questions. 
          - The answer in this dataset are syntactically and semantically closer to the question than to the KG triple.
